# unit-4-game

This game matches the assignment specifications, and here are some additional small touches:

1. The crystal number values are all unique for each game. They are randomly generated as the assignment indicates, 
but the second, third, and fourth generated numbers are checked against the existing numbers, and then re-generated
if the value is a duplicate.

2. For quality assurance and TA testing purposes, the crystal number values can be viewed in the Chrome console during each game.

3. A winning or losing message is flashed for 4.5 seconds at the end of each game using setTimeout.

4. These particular crystal images were created by me using a free online application called Tinkercad.
